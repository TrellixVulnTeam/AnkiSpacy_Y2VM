# SpaCy Package Manager
**[spaCy](http://spacy.io) is a free, open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) in Python. This addon provides a way to install spaCy and its models, making them available
to other addons. For more information on how this addon works and a list of addons that use this
addon see the [github repo](http://github.com/rteabeault/AnkiSpacy).**
 
**As you install spacy and its models the following icons may be observed:**

<img src="{checkmark_file}" alt="drawing" width="17"/> **Indicates that the package is currently 
installed.**

<img src="{refresh_file}" alt="drawing" width="17"/> **Indicates there is a newer version of the
package available.**

<img src="{incompatible_file}" alt="drawing" width="17"/> **For a model indicates that spaCy is
not installed or the version installed is not compatible the installed version of the model.**
